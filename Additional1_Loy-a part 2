Write an algorithm to read 100 numbers and then display the sum. 
1.Start
2.Initialize i, j=100, and sum=0 
3.Compute i value in for = (i = 0; i <= j; i++;) 
4.Display the computed i in the body of for loop
5.If the computed i value is true then go back to step 3
6.If the computed i value is false then head to step 9
7.Compute sum+=i 
8.Display the sum
9.Stop

Write an algorithm to read two numbers then display the largest.
1.Start
2.Initialize num1=0 and num2=0
3.Input values of num1 and num2
4. Compute for the greater than and smaller than of the two variables.
num1>num2, num1<2
5.If num1 is > num2, then the largest number is num 1, and If num1 is > num2, then the largest number is num 2
6.Display the largest 
7.Stop

Write an algorithm to read two numbers then display the smallest
1.Start
2.Initialize num1=0 and num2=0
3.Input values of num1 and num2
4. Compute for the greater than and smaller than of the two variables.
num1>num2, num1<2
5.If num1 is > num2, then the smallest number is num 2 and If num1 is > num2, then the smallest number is num 1
6.Display the smallest 
7.Stop

Write an algorithm to read three numbers then display the largest.
1.Start
2.Initialize num1, num2, and num3
3.Input values of num1, num2, and num3 
4.Process if num1 is > num2 and if num 1 is > than 3, then else if num2> num 1 and else if num 2 > num3, and then else num 3
5.Compute if num1 > num2 and num 1 > than 3 then the largest is num1 or else if num2> num 1 and num 2 > num3 then the largest is num 2 and then else num 3 then the largest is num3.
6.Display the largest 
7.Stop
