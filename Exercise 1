1.What is Computer?
It is a machine that is designed and supported with both hardware and software systems to do specific tasks to/ help 
serve the user's needs. The computer processes information that is requested by the user and carries them out to
do what the user  has commandeds to ask, depending on what computer systems is under, it is able to perform 
simple tasks request to harder and complex commands. The computer is a machine programmed to help and assists humans
in their lives, humans create and invent  different kinds of machinery as a tool to help them out in their daily 
lives, and the computer is one of those inventions that try to attempt in helping humans.


2.What are the essential parts of computer
Central Processing Unit (CPU)- It is the human brain of the computer. Its functions is to process problems and break 
down information and also do commands to make actions to do normal computer tasks for the user. Modern CPUs nowadays
are more advanced which makes systems perform faster without abusing the computer itself.

Motherboard- it is the one of the most important thing in a computer hardware, is the motherboard. The Motherboard
is the element of the computer hardware that holds every hardware together in one place, it helps piece things 
together in order for the computer to be whole. The Motherboard can come in different varieties meaning 
that each Motherbaord can make have different design on the computer system itself. Like different circuit 
designs, different wire connections, etc.

Random Access Memory (RAM)- It is the device that is able to store data and information. It is able to make the
computer stay relevant and updated at all times. This helps the computer to always remember its functions. With 
this device this makes the computer always feel fresh and  because of this, it makes the computer less prone to 
errors or any disfunctions and is ready to accept new and more data stored. But the downside of this it is only
temporary.

Cooling fan- When a computer is being used it produces heat in the hardware, but sometimes the computer would
overheat that it would be in critical condition if to continue to be sued. Thankfully there is a cooling fan
is there to help to maintain the computer's heat, the fan will help the computer stay in stable use and can stay
functional for the user to used. But the cooling fan only has limited power and it would not be able enough to
cool down the computer's heat itself.


3. Who are the notable inventors of hardware and software? Cite (5) software developers and (5) hardware developers
Computers have come so far in evolving and has become one of the most useful and important things in our modern 
generations, and it would not come this far if it was not for the people who help contribute in the industry 
itself. here are 5 notable software and hardware  developers

*Software developers*
I.Linus Torvads- Known as the founding father of the the Linux Operating System, He created it because he needed a 
new programming system for his MS-DOS-driven PC at that time, he wanted to create a similar Unix operating system, 
with his programming experience from when he was in college, he was able to make it possible and then share it to 
the world and he has know become one of the most famous software developers in the world.

II.Dennis Ritchie- He was known to be the father of C programming language, this all happened in the early days when 
the Dennis was helping to develop Unix, Ritchie began modifying B programming language, adding data and syntax 
characteristics that turned B into the famously known C programming in 1972. Unix components were at first written 
in B, but then slowly turned into C programming language,. And because of this, C programming became one of the most 
important and useful programs to have ever existed.

III.James Gosling- the person who made the Java programming language, the java programming language started in 1991 
as a project as Gosling tries to create a new programming language with a few of his colleagues that aimed towards 
the technology trends of digital divergence in TVs, computers, telephones, set-top boxes, and other embedded systems. 
Java is know mostlty used in many different devices and applications such as desktop computing, scientific studies, 
enterprise applications, web servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices and is widely used in computer science 
education.

IV.Ada Lovelace- The very first computer programmer according to history, she was the reason as to why computer coding 
thrive and has open doors and opportunities for coding to evolve. This all started when computers were introduced by 
Charles Babbage, computers were only limited to function with mathematical languages, but Lovelace was able to discover 
and invent a coding languages that can be programmed other than just using mathematical languages, and so that is how 
she revolutionized the coding language itself.

V.Bjarne Stroustrup- He was the man who develop making the c++ program language. He created this language for users to 
more accessibility with creating very advanced coding to focus on more than the hardware required. With the use of the 
c programming language he tried to enhance the language itself and it resulted into the creation of c++ we know today. 
He created the c++ programming when he was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis in Bell Labs back in the year 1979

*Hardware developers*
I.Charles Babbage- the man who invented computers, he was the man that revolutionzed technology itself, and has became
one of the most used machinery in our modern day. He is a mathematician and for the most part, only thought calculus 
functions. Around that time Babbage invented a machine that can difference machine where it does mathematical tables
for the user, then he thought of creating a machine that can perform any mathematical tasks. Which is he called it the 
Analytical engine, it had very similar functions to the computer we know today. But sadly his idea was too advance at 
that time and sadly his invention showed only results he did not want. Although Babbage's Analytical engine did not 
came true, George Scheutz was able to adapt his invention and make come to reality.


II.Georg Scheutz- He was the man that was able to make a the first workable computer, something that Charles Babbage 
tried to create. He was the man that also invented the first printing calculator. It is a machine that is able to
perform mathematical differencial tasks. The reason for this invention was that he was inspired by Charles Babbage's
contributions and decided to follow his footsteps.
