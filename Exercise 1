1.What is Computer?
 It is a machine that is designed and supported with both hardware and software systems to do specific tasks to/ help serve the user's needs. The computer processes information that is requested by the user and carries them out to do what the user has commandeds to ask, depending on what computer systems is under, it is able to perform simple tasks request to harder and complex commands. The computer is a machine programmed to help and assists humans in their lives, humans create and invent different kinds of machinery as a tool to help them out in their daily life, and the computer is one of those but, what separates them


2.What are the essential parts of computer
Central Processing Unit (CPU)- it is the one that takes and processes information, very similar to how the human brain works. It breaks down and receives information so the computer can communicate back by responding to the data.
Motherboard- it is on


3. Who are the notable inventors of hardware and software? Cite (5) software developers and (5) hardware developers
Computers have come so far in evolving and has become one of the most useful and important things in our modern generations, and it would not come this far if it was not for the people who help contribute in the industry itself. here are 5 notable software and hardware  developers

*Software developers*
I.Linus Torvads- Known as the founding father of the the Linux Operating System, He created it because he needed a new programming system for his MS-DOS-driven PC at that time, he wanted to create a similar Unix operating system, with his programming experience from when he was in college, he was able to make it possible and then share it to the world and he has know become one of the most famous software developers in the world.

II.Dennis Ritchie- He was known to be the father of C programming language, this all happened in the early days when the Dennis was helping to develop Unix, Ritchie began modifying B programming language, adding data and syntax characteristics that turned B into the famously known C programming in 1972. Unix components were at first written in B, but then slowly turned into C programming language,. And because of this, C programming became one of the most important and useful programs to have ever existed.

III.James Gosling- the person who made the Java programming language, the java programming language started in 1991 as a project as Gosling tries to create a new programming language with a few of his colleagues that aimed towards the technology trends of digital divergence in TVs, computers, telephones, set-top boxes, and other embedded systems. Java is know mostlty used in many different devices and applications such as desktop computing, scientific studies, enterprise applications, web servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices and is widely used in computer science education.

IV.Ada Lovelace- The very first computer programmer according to history, she was the reason as to why computer coding thrive and has open doors and opportunities for coding to evolve. This all started when computers were introduced by Charles Babbage, computers were only limited to function with mathematical languages, but Lovelace was able to discover and invent a coding languages that can be programmed other than just using mathematical languages, and so that is how she revolutionized the coding language itself

V.Bjarne Stroustrup- He was the man who develop making the c++ program language. He created this language for users to more accessibility with creating very advanced coding to focus on more than the hardware required. With the use of the c programming language he tried to enhance the language itself and it resulted into the creation of c++ we know today. He created the c++ programming when he was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis in Bell Labs back in the year 1979

*Hardware developers*
I.Charles Babbage- the man who invented computers, he was the man that revolutionzed technology itself,
