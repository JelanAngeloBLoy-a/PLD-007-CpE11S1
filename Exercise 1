1. It is a device that is designed with both hardware and software systems to do specific tasks to help serve the user's needs. The computer processes information that was requested by the user and carries them out to do what the user has commandeds to ask, 
depending on what computer systems is under, it is able to perform from simple tasks and request to harder and complex commands with the help of a robotic system known as AI to carry out these tasks. 

2.In the essential parts of a computer, these things are what makes the physical form of a computer. 

*The first here is the Central Processing Unit (CPU)- it is the one that takes and processes information, very similar to how the brain works. It breaks down information to
try to understand and also know what to do so it can help the computer to perform tasks for the user

3. Computers have come so far in evolving and has become one of the most useful and important things in our modern generations, and it would not come this far if it was not for the people who help contribute in the industry itself. here are 5 notable software
and hardware  developers

Software developers
*Linus Torvads- The founder or the person who created the Linux Operating System, he created it because he needed a new programming sytem for his MS-DOS-driven PC to create a similar Unix operating system, with his progarmming experience he was able to make it possible and
he became knowable to the world because of it
*Dennis Ritchie- He was known to be the father of C programming language, this all happened in the early days when the development of Unix, Ritchie began modifying B, adding data and syntax characteristics that turned B into the famously known C progrtamming in 1972.
Unix components were at first written in B, but then slowly turned into C, culminating with the kernel in 1973. Thus, C programming became one of the most important and useful programs to have ever existed.
*James Gosling- the perso who made the Java programming language, in 1991 they started making the project as they try to create a new programming language that aimed at computers, the notion, popular then, of the “digital convergence” of TVs, computers, telephones,
set-top boxes, and other embedded systems. Java is know moslty used in many different devices and applications such as desktop computing, scientific studies, enterprise applications, web servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices and is widely used in
computer science education.
*Ada Lovelace- The very first computer programmer according to history.
