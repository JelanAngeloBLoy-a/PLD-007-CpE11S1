1.What is Computer?
It is a machine that is designed and supported with both hardware and software systems to do specific tasks to/ help 
serve the user's needs. The computer processes information that is requested by the user and carries them out to
do what the user  has commandeds to ask, depending on what computer systems is under, it is able to perform 
simple tasks request to harder and complex commands. The computer is a machine programmed to help and assists humans
in their lives, humans create and invent  different kinds of machinery as a tool to help them out in their daily 
lives, and the computer is one of those inventions that try to attempt in helping humans.


2.What are the essential parts of computer
*Central Processing Unit (CPU)- It is the human brain of the computer. Its functions is to process problems and break 
down information and also do commands to make actions to do normal computer tasks for the user. Modern CPUs nowadays
are more advanced which makes systems perform faster without abusing the computer itself.


*Motherboard- it is the one of the most important thing in a computer hardware, is the motherboard. The Motherboard
is the element of the computer hardware that holds every hardware together in one place, it helps piece things 
together in order for the computer to be whole. The Motherboard can come in different varieties meaning 
that each Motherbaord can make have different design on the computer system itself. Like different circuit 
designs, different wire connections, etc.


*Random Access Memory (RAM)- It is the device that is able to store data and information. It is able to make the
computer stay relevant and updated at all times. This helps the computer to always remember its functions. With 
this device this makes the computer always feel fresh and  because of this, it makes the computer less prone to 
errors or any disfunctions and is ready to accept new and more data stored. But the downside of this it is only
temporary.

*Cooling fan- When a computer is being used it produces heat in the hardware, but sometimes the computer would
overheat that it would be in critical condition if to continue to be sued. Thankfully there is a cooling fan
is there to help to maintain the computer's heat, the fan will help the computer stay in stable use and can stay
functional for the user to used. But the cooling fan only has limited power and it would not be able enough to
cool down the computer's heat itself.

*Microchip- it is a small electronic system chip, that is composed of transistors, resistors, and capacitors
where the resistors are in charge of manipluating electric flow in the transistors, the transistors are 
ones that functions as an on and off switch of the microchip, and ther capacitor saves and relases. Its functions 
is to be the computer processor for logic or to process computer memory similar to how RAM acts.

*Keyboard- it is a board with buttons to press that is set up with a group of letters, numbers, symbols, and functions, 
displayed on the computer. when you push a button on a specific letter, number, symbol, and function it will
follow the command and it would show the effects and result on the computer. They are one of the important
components of a computer as this is a way for people to communicate with the computer itself.

*Power supply- it is a system that supplies some parts of the computer with the correct amount of power for it 
to function. The way it works is that it takes power from a source like a power outlet, and then turn it into 
direct current power. With a stable power supply the computer would not be able to have any malfunctions
or any errors when being currently used.

*Hard drive- it is a disk that is responsible for storing and retrieving data and information, with the use
of magnetic disks it is able to help to store data in order for it to not be lost. In most computers it is
stored deep in the computer casing. With the hard drive it able to perform tasks such as storing the 
operating system, software, and user data for the computer to function well.


3. Who are the notable inventors of hardware and software? Cite (5) software developers and (5) hardware developers.
Computers have come so far in evolving and has become one of the most useful and important things in our modern 
generations, and it would not come this far if it was not for the people who help contribute in the industry 
itself. here are 5 notable software and hardware developers.

*Software developers*
I.Linus Torvads- Known as the founding father of the  Linux Operating System. Enrolled at the University of 
Helsinki and studied C programming classes. He created Linux Operating System because he needed a new programming system for his 
MS-DOS-driven PC at that time, he wanted to create a similar Unix operating system, with his programming experience 
from when he was in college, he was able to make it possible and then share it to the world and he has know become 
one of the most famous software developers in the world.

II.Dennis Ritchie- He was known to be the father of C programming language. Studied at Harvard as an undergraduate 
of physics and a doctoral degree in applied mathematics. This all happened in the early days when the Dennis was 
helping to develop Unix, Ritchie began modifying B programming language, adding data and syntax characteristics 
that turned B into the famously known C programming in 1972. Unix components were at first written in B, but then 
slowly turned into C programming language,. And because of this, C programming became one of the most important and 
useful programs to have ever existed.

III.James Gosling- the person who made the Java programming language. He has a BS in computer science and graduated 
from the University of Calgary. the java programming language started in 1991 as a project as Gosling tries to 
create a new programming language with a few of his colleagues that aimed towards the technology trends of digital 
divergence in TVs, computers, telephones, set-top boxes, and other embedded systems. Java is know mostlty used in 
many different devices and applications such as desktop computing, scientific studies, enterprise applications, 
web servers, embedded systems, and mobile devices and is widely used in computer science education.

IV.Ada Lovelace- She is an english mathematician and a writer and she was the very first computer programmer 
according to history, she was the reason as to why computer coding thrive and has open doors and opportunities 
for coding to evolve. This all started when computers were introduced by Charles Babbage, computers were only limited 
to function with mathematical languages, but Lovelace was able to discover and invent a coding languages that 
can be programmed other than just using mathematical languages, and so that is how she revolutionized the coding 
language itself.

V.Bjarne Stroustrup- He was the man who develop making the c++ program language. He created this language for users to 
more accessibility with creating very advanced coding to focus on more than the hardware required. With the use of the 
c programming language he tried to enhance the language itself and it resulted into the creation of c++ we know today. 
He created the c++ programming when he was doing work for his Ph.D. thesis in Bell Labs back in the year 1979.


*Hardware developers*
I.Charles Babbage- the man who invented computers, he was the man that revolutionzed technology itself, and has became
one of the most used machinery in our modern day. He is a mathematician and for the most part, only thought calculus 
functions. Around that time Babbage invented a machine that can difference machine where it does mathematical tables
for the user, then he thought of creating a machine that can perform any mathematical tasks. Which is he called it the 
Analytical engine, it had very similar functions to the computer we know today. But sadly his idea was too advance at 
that time and sadly his invention showed only results he did not want. Although Babbage's Analytical engine did not 
came true, George Scheutz was able to adapt his invention and make come to reality.

II.Georg Scheutz- He was the man that was able to make a the first workable computer, something that Charles Babbage 
tried to create. He was the man that also invented the first printing calculator. It is a machine that is able to
perform mathematical differencial tasks. The reason for this invention was that he was inspired by Charles Babbage's
contributions and decided to follow his footsteps.

III.Nathaniel Baldwin- Nathaniel was an engineer and is the man that invented the headphones, when Baldwin first made
the invention, it was nothing but a fun concept to him, he made it so he can listen purely to music, but he was not
expecting it to be used by the navy themselves and ordered a bunch of these to him. The headphones he made at that
time was only handmade in his kitchen and was only made with cheap equipment he can find in order to make it into
use, but because of this small fun concept this helped  revolutionized technology itself without headphones we 
would not be able to enjoy our lives listening to music privately.

IV.Karl Ferdinand Braun- He was considered the father of computer monitors. He became very interested with math, science 
and electricity. Karl went to the University of Strasbourg in 1895 and is a physics professor there, during his
teaching times he one day invented a functioning cathode-ray direction finder or oscilloscope, with this invention
he used it, as an example to how cathode ray tube technology work. Because of his amazing invention of the 
cathode-ray tube (CRT), he was able to make an invention that can show digital images with the help of technology.

V.Alexander Graham Bell- Alexander was credited as the creator of the telephone. Alexander was homeschooled througout
his life, but was able to attend the University of Edinburgh.  Although there are many that says that there are 
other people who have contributed to the creation of the telephone, he was able to defend his credentials to the
invention of the telephone and has made a company called Bell Telephone Company in 1877.
